### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2 ended up being one of my favorite parts of the course 
    because it involved using loops to create a descending pattern. I really 
    enjoyed figuring out how the code should work and using logic and a bit 
    of math to set up the for loop correctly. At first, loops were a bit 
    confusing, especially when it came to understanding how they actually ran. 
    But after spending some time breaking them down, they quickly became one of 
    my favorite parts of coding. I was really excited when I got the pattern to 
    work on my third try after testing out two other loop methods.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 quickly became another favorite of mine because it introduced 
    the concept of working with filesâ€”whether it is saving information to them or 
    pulling data from them. I found it really interesting because it made the 
    coding feel more practical and useful, like it was opening up new possibilities. 
    The whole process of the lab was fun, especially storing words from a file into 
    a string vector using loops. It felt like a smart and efficient way to manage 
    data. I also enjoyed creating functions to pull words from a dictionary and 
    then compare them with another text to check for any unfamiliar words. 
    It was exciting to experiment with that and see how it all worked.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, Part 1 was really interesting for me. It introduced the concept of 
    classes, which opened up a whole new area of programming. This part also 
    revisited a previous lab about states, but this time approached it through 
    classes. Learning how to use classes to achieve the same result in a different 
    way really highlighted that there is often more than one path to get to the 
    same outcome. It also showed how using classes can make the code more 
    efficient and organized, leading to better results.
